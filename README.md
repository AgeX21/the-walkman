*This project uses a modified version of NDSLIB*

## Gameplay

<p>The walkman is a game that is all about walking while listening to some fantastic tunes on your good old walkman.<br>

There are 9 songs to choose from using the walkman interface and you can stroll around in 2 custom maps, the city and the countryside.</p>

**Take in the view and relax.</br>**

### Touchscreen

- <p>On the subscreen you can use the touchscreen to interact with the walkman, you can : <br> 
    - skip to previous track <br>
    - skip to next track <br>
    - pause and play <br>
- There's also a special orange button which is a shortcut to transport you back to the other map. 
- It is recommended to use the stylus of the NDS as the hitboxes for the buttons are quite narrow.
